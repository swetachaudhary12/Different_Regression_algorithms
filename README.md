# Different_Regression_algorithms
"In this project, we conducted a comprehensive analysis to predict material strength using various regression algorithms, including Linear Regression, Gradient Descent, Normal Equation, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Generalized Linear Model (GLM). Our approach involved feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical learning techniques to identify the best-fitting model for the task. Through a systematic evaluation, we determined the optimal regression method that provides accurate predictions for material strength."
